# Project Description

After listening to Jaime explain his project in class he gave me an idea to do something similar but kind of different. In E2 there was a question with the Chinese New Year and as a mix of Jaime's project and that question I got my project idea. My project will tell someone how compatible they are to another person based on both of the person's astrology sign. It will first tell you what your sign is, then the other persons sign. After that it will print what percentage of compatibility you have. 



## Project Code

If it makes sense for your project, you can have code and outputs here in the notebook as well.


```python
from my_module.functions import *
```

 ### Chat Bot
The start_the_chat function begins the chatbot.



```python
start_the_chat()
```
