# # Project Description

# After listening to Jaime explain his project in class he gave me an idea to do something similar but kind of different. In E2 there was a question with the Chinese New Year and as a mix of Jaime's project and that question I got my project idea. My project will tell someone how compatible they are to another person based on both of the person's astrology sign. It will first tell you what your sign is, then the other persons sign. After that it will print what percentage of compatibility you have.
