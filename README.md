# COGS-18-Horoscope-Chatbot- Final Project
### Description
I created a chatbot that will tell the user what signs they are the most and least compatible. First the chatbot will ask the user if they would like to know the zodiac, to which the user will answer yes/no. If the user says yes, it will ask for their birth month and then their birth date. If the user says no, it will ask if they want to exit the chat. After after getting the users full birth date it will repeat their birth date to the user along with their assigned zodiac sign. Then the user will be asked if they want to know which sign they are compatible with. If they say yes the chatbot will tell them what signs they are the most and least compatible with. Then they will be able to exit the chat. If at anytime the user answers no, they will be asked if they want to exit the chat. 
### Notes
- When using the chatbot please start with captital letters, for example when typing yes you would type "Yes". 
- When typing your birth month, please type the whole month and start with a capital letter, for example "September"
- When typing the day of birth, you can type the number. For example "1". 
- There is also no need for periods, or complete sentences.
